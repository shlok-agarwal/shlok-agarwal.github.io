ingredients:
  - Serves 3
  - 6 eggs
  - 1/2 cup dry quinoa (1+ 1/2 cup cooked)
  - 300g red bell peppers

  - 3 tbsp rice vinegar 
  - oregano
  - lemon, salt and pepper

steps:
  - Heat oven at 400F
  - Add the bell pepper slices and cherry tomatoes to the baking tray, and add a quick spray of cooking oil before tossing
  - Season with oregano, salt and pepper.
  - Roast for 20-30 minutes (until cooked).
  - Boil the eggs and cook the quinoa
  - For the dressing add 3 tbsp of rice vinegar, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper to each one with a big squeeze of lemon/lime juice
  - Add salad dressing, lettuce mix, roasted veggies, quinoa and give the salad a toss.

notes: If you would prefer a vegan option, then omit the eggs. Drain and rinse pinto beans, which you can mix with the quinoa, once the quinoa is cooked.
