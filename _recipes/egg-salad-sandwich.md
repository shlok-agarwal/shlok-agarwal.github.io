ingredients:
  - bread
  - eggs
  - mayonnaise
  - tomatoes
  - spinach
  - lemon
  - onion powder
  - oregano, salt, pepper

steps:
  - Boil the eggs. Peel the eggs and slice them in small pieces.
  - Mix the chopped egg with 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise, a squeeze of lemon/lime juice, oregano, a sprinkle of onion powder, salt and pepper.
  - Cut the tomato into thick slices
  - Lightly toast the bread (optional) and add it to a plate with the lettuce
  - Add the egg salad to the bread and top it with tomato slices

notes: You can make an open sandwich to save on calories from the other piece of bread. If you want to make a sandwich to take to school/work, it is best to make a closed sandwich. Put the egg salad on the first slice, then add a few small cherry tomato slices. Place the lettuce on top of the tomato so that the tomato doesn't touch the bread, which could make it soggy.
