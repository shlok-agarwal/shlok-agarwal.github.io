# Research & Publications

My research focuses on advancing the capabilities of legged robots through innovative control algorithms, proprioceptive sensing, and adaptive behaviors. I'm passionate about creating robots that can operate reliably in real-world environments without relying on external perception systems.

## Research Interests

### Legged Locomotion Control
Developing robust control algorithms that enable quadruped robots to traverse complex terrains, including stairs, steep slopes, and unstructured environments. My work emphasizes proprioceptive control - using internal robot sensors rather than cameras or lidar for navigation.

### Whole-Body Control & Manipulation
Integrating locomotion and manipulation capabilities to create robots that can perform complex tasks like door opening, object manipulation, and collaborative operations while maintaining dynamic balance.

### Recovery & Fault-Tolerant Behaviors
Designing self-righting algorithms and recovery behaviors that allow robots to continue operation after disturbances, falls, or component failures - critical for real-world deployments.

### Adaptive Gait Generation
Creating terrain-adaptive locomotion strategies that automatically adjust robot gaits based on ground conditions, slope angles, and environmental challenges.
