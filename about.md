# About Me

Hello! I'm Shlok Agarwal, Lead Controls Software Engineer at Ghost Robotics, where I specialize in developing advanced locomotion and manipulation algorithms for legged robots. My journey in robotics has taken me from designing miniature humanoid robots in India to leading cutting-edge quadruped development in Philadelphia, with deployments spanning across continents.

## My Story

I grew up in India and moved to the US in 2016 for my graduate studies. My fascination with robotics began during my undergraduate studies in Mechatronics at Manipal Institute of Technology, where I first encountered the challenge of making machines move and think autonomously. This curiosity led me through diverse experiences - from working with humanoid robots in Bangalore to developing exoskeleton models at IHMC, and eventually to my current role advancing legged robotics.

My career has been defined by pushing the boundaries of what legged robots can achieve. At Ghost Robotics, I've been part of the company's journey from an early-stage startup to a leading player in the field, helping develop robots that can navigate stairs, traverse high-incline slopes, and recover from falls - all without relying on visual sensors.

## Education

**MS in Robotics Engineering** - Worcester Polytechnic Institute (2016-2018)  
*GPA: 3.8/4.0 - Thesis: Study of Toe Joints to Enhance Locomotion of Legged Systems*

**BTech in Mechatronics** - Manipal Institute of Technology (2010-2014)  
*GPA: 3.6/4.0 - Focus on robotics, automation engineering, and control systems*

## Professional Experience

**Lead Controls Software** - Ghost Robotics (2025-Present)  
Leading low-level software development, arm behavior systems, and customer support

**Senior Controls Engineer** - Ghost Robotics (2021-2024)  
Developed proprioceptive gait strategies, whole-body control frameworks, and recovery behaviors

**Controls Engineer** - Ghost Robotics (2018-2021)  
Designed self-righting algorithms, terrain-adaptive locomotion, and early robot deployments

**Design Engineer** - Sirena Technologies (2014-2016)  
Developed ZMP-based walking controller for 16-DOF humanoid robot "Nino"

## Technical Expertise

### Core Specializations
- **Legged Locomotion Control**: Proprioceptive gaits, terrain adaptation, recovery behaviors
- **Whole-Body Control**: Integration of locomotion and manipulation for complex tasks
- **Robot Dynamics**: Kinematics, dynamics modeling, and optimization-based control
- **Embedded Systems**: Real-time control architecture, hardware-software integration

### Programming & Tools
- **Languages**: C++, Python, MATLAB, Bash
- **Robotics**: ROS/ROS2, control algorithms, state machines (FSMs)
- **Development**: Git, CI/CD, AWS, simulation frameworks
- **Hardware**: Robot assembly, field testing, sensor integration

## Research & Publications

My research focuses on advancing legged robotion capabilities through proprioceptive control and adaptive behaviors. I've published 7 peer-reviewed papers with 93+ citations, including work on:

- Humanoid locomotion enhancement through toe joint design
- Stability analysis for robot-assisted balance systems
- Open-source interfaces for generic humanoid robots
- Extended state machines for robust robot performance

As an IEEE Senior Member, I also serve as a reviewer for top-tier conferences including ICRA, IROS, and IEEE/ASME Transactions.

## Personal Interests

Beyond robotics, I've developed a deep passion for food, health, and fitness. I enjoy:
- Cooking traditional Indian dishes and exploring ways to merge robotics with food preparation
- Practicing CrossFit and maintaining a healthy lifestyle
- Exploring how automation can reduce food waste and improve nutrition

I believe that the intersection of robotics and daily life activities like cooking and health can lead to meaningful improvements in how we live.

## Philosophy

I believe robotics has the potential to solve real-world challenges by operating in the environments where humans live and work. My focus on legged robotics stems from the conviction that mobility and manipulation control is fundamental to useful robots - they need to navigate stairs, uneven terrain, and complex environments just as we do. Through proprioceptive control and adaptive behaviors, we can create robots that are robust, reliable, and ready for deployment in the real world.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss robotics, share insights about legged locomotion, or explore collaboration opportunities. Whether you're interested in the technical details of proprioceptive control or the broader implications of mobile robotics, I'd love to hear from you.
