I'm **Shlok Agarwal**, Lead Controls Software Engineer at Ghost Robotics, where I specialize in legged locomotion, manipulation, and autonomous robotic systems. With over a decade of experience in robotics, I bridge cutting-edge research with real-world deployments across defense, industrial, and exploration applications.

> "Creating robots that can walk through the world, not just see it."

## What I Do

🦾 **Legged Locomotion** - Developing adaptive gaits and recovery behaviors for quadruped robots  
🧠 **Manipulation** - Improving manipulation control and developing applications to extend quadruped capabilities  
⚡ **Sustainable Software Development** - Create and maintain reliable software by navigating the complexities of product development and deployment.
🌍 **Real-World Deployment** - Supporting military and industrial clients with field-tested solutions  

## Current Focus

I currently lead the controls software development at Ghost Robotics, focusing on advancing the capabilities of legged robots to operate in diverse and challenging environments. My work has enabled robots to traverse stairs, steep slopes, and complex terrains without relying on external perception sensors.
