  - Measure out 2 tablespoons of peanut butter 2 tablespoons of rice/coconut vinegar, lemon/lime juice, oregano, salt and pepper. Mix everything together until it makes a smooth dressing
  - Add the lettuce/baby spinach as a base. Add the roasted sweet potatoes, chickpeas and cherry tomatoes to the plate
