Hello! I'm Shlok Agarwal, Lead Controls Software Engineer at Ghost Robotics, where I specialize in developing advanced locomotion and manipulation algorithms for legged robots. My journey in robotics has taken me from designing miniature humanoid robots in India to leading cutting-edge quadruped development in Philadelphia, with deployments spanning across continents.

## Career Story

I grew up in India and moved to the US in 2016 for my graduate studies. My fascination with robotics began during my undergraduate studies in Mechatronics at Manipal Institute of Technology, where I first encountered the challenge of making machines move and think autonomously. This curiosity led me through diverse experiences from working with humanoid robots in Bangalore to developing exoskeleton models at IHMC, and eventually to my current role advancing legged robotics at Ghost Robotics.

My career has been defined by pushing the boundaries of what legged robots can achieve. At Ghost Robotics, I've been part of the company's journey from an early-stage startup to a leading player in the field, helping develop robots that can navigate stairs, traverse high-incline slopes, and recover from falls - all without relying on visual sensors.


## Personal Interests

Outside of robotics, I have cultivated a strong passion for food, health, and fitness.

- Cooking: I enjoy preparing traditional Indian dishes and experimenting with ways to combine robotics with food preparation and automation.
- CrossFit: An active CrossFitter, I’ve competed in the CrossFit Open since 2022.
- Running: Each spring, I challenge myself with a 10K run as a personal benchmark. In 2024, I also completed a half marathon—though I quickly discovered that shorter distances are a better fit for me.
- Health & Nutrition: I have explored holistic approaches to wellness, including a 10-day naturopathy program in India and a 6-month nutrition course with a dietitian to deepen my understanding of natural health practices.

I believe that the intersection of robotics and daily life activities like cooking and health can lead to meaningful improvements in how we live.

## Philosophy

I believe robotics has the potential to solve real-world challenges by operating in the environments where humans live and work. My focus on legged robotics stems from the conviction that mobility and manipulation control is fundamental to useful robots as robots need to navigate stairs, uneven terrain, and complex environments just as we do. Through proprioceptive control and adaptive behaviors, we can create robots that are robust, reliable, and ready for deployment in the real world.
