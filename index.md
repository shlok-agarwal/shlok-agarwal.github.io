# Welcome to My Robotics Universe

I'm **Shlok Agarwal**, Lead Controls Software Engineer at Ghost Robotics, where I specialize in legged locomotion, proprioceptive control, and autonomous robotic systems. With over a decade of experience in robotics, I bridge cutting-edge research with real-world deployments across defense, industrial, and exploration applications.

## What I Do

ü¶æ **Legged Locomotion** - Developing adaptive gaits and recovery behaviors for quadruped robots  
üß† **Proprioceptive Control** - Creating sensor-free navigation algorithms using internal robot sensing  
‚ö° **Whole-Body Control** - Implementing advanced control frameworks for complex robot behaviors  
üåç **Real-World Deployment** - Supporting military and industrial clients with field-tested solutions  

## Current Focus

I currently lead the controls software development at Ghost Robotics, focusing on advancing the capabilities of legged robots to operate in diverse and challenging environments. My work has enabled robots to traverse stairs, steep slopes, and complex terrains without relying on external perception sensors.

## Latest Updates

- üöÄ **Leadership Role**: Promoted to Lead Controls Software Engineer at Ghost Robotics
- üìù **Recent Patent**: Filed patent for proprioceptive robotic door opening system
